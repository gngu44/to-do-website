# 📋 To-do Website

Welcome to my first website! This is a simple website used to practice the React framework as well as other web-dev skills. Included is a basic to-do list with whatever else I felt like adding.  

## 📝 Tools and Skills

- React
- Vite
- HTML
- CSA
- JavaScript

## 🗃️ Website Structure
Multiple components each with different purposes:

- Input: text field for adding new tasks
- Item: displays a single task with options to check off, edit, and delete
- List: renders new task item components
- Footer: Filters tasks based on status and displays remaining tasks

## ⛳️ Future Goals

- [ ] Make website publily available with vercel server hosting
- [ ] Add extra functionality by allowing user to add files to individual tasks (shows file preview/image)
- [ ] Add coloring options and re-ordering for extra organization
